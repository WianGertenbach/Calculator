# Calculator

## General Notes
The calculator is a basic one with limited operations. I included a factorial operation just for fun. Overall the project complies with all the requirements specified by the assignment (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator), except for when a user inputs multiple operator symbols. In this case, the calculator takes the first value as the one provided after the last operator symbol. 

## Using The Calculator
Open the calculator here: https://wiangertenbach.github.io/Calculator/
Using the calculator is exactly the same as for any other. You click the values you want to provide, do the operation and obtain a result. 

Note: **The calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.**

Therefore, use the calculator as follows:
- Click in the first number
- Click the operator you want to use
- Click the second number
- Press '='
- Click another operator you want to use to continue the calculation. 

This isn't exactly as specified by The Odin Project, as I realised just after doing the finishing touches. The calculator still does the calculations correctly though. I'm submitting this version for now and will push an update again a bit later.
